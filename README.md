# CLV-Prediction-and-Customer-Segmentation

Thsi is a Working Project. Estimated time of completion: 30-April-2025

The aim of this project is to predict the CLV for a dataset of customers, whether they will be part of the business and how much revenue the company can expect to earn from them. I identified a datset in Kaggle containing valueable features with which we can estimate CLV for a customer and train the model using it. Later, we should segment them and test the model's prediction accuracy with unseen data/testing data from the dataset.

Dataset: Digital Wallets (Paytm/Google Pay) Dataset.
